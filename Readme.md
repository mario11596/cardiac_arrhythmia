# Cardiac arrhythmia prediction based on machine learning

## About

Today, arrhythmia is one of the diseases that can be easily diagnosed, but also successfully treated with the necessary medication. In this project, I will present five machine learning algorithms that could be used to diagnose cardiac arrhythmia.The algorithms used are as follows: Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boost, Support Vector Machine (C-Support Vector) and K-Nearest Neighbour.

## Dataset
The dataset that I used is from the website [UCI Machine learning repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/arrhythmia). It consists of 452 instances and 279 attributes with 16 classes as target.

| Class code | Class                                      | Number of instances |
|---------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| 01 | Normal	| 245  |
| 02 | Ischemic changes (Coronary Artery Disease) | 44 |
| 03 | Old Anterior Myocardial Infarction | 15 |
| 04 | Old Inferior Myocardial Infarction | 15 |
| 05 | Sinus tachycardy| 13 |
| 06 | Sinus bradycardy| 25  |
| 07 | Ventricular Premature Contraction (PVC) | 3 |
| 08 | Supraventricular Premature Contraction | 2  |
| 09 | Left bundle branch block  | 9  |
| 10 | Right bundle branch block | 50 |
| 11 | 1. degree AtrioVentricular block | 0 |
| 12 | 2. degree AV block | 0 |
| 13 | 3. degree AV block | 0 |
| 14 | Left ventricule hypertrophy | 4 |
| 15 | Atrial Fibrillation or Flutter | 5 |
| 16 | Others	| 22 |
